# Udacity-WeRateDogs-Project

WeRateDogs is a known twitter handle that rates dog pictures posted on twitter.
In this project i got to gather data from different sources. The sources were from a twitter archive csv file given, Udacity server files containing 
images which was gathered through requests and stored as a tsv file and a JSON file obtained from Twitter through Twitter API.
All files were read into dataframes and were duly cleaned and assessed.
After addressing the quality and tidiness issues, I saved the data into a master dataframe exported as a csv file.
I also did a quick analysis of Dog Types & Breeds based on favorite and retweet counts as i needed to know the type of dog to get for my sister.
After my analysis, I was able to narrow down my search backed up with a visualization of the top average rating of Dogs on the WeRateDogs Twitter account.
The project was great to work on as it contained data from different sources and had a lot of data to assess and clean as you'd get to see.
